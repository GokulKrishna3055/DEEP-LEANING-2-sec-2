I didn\\u2019t have time for the romanticized writer existence where one sips freshly brewed coffee while wearing their threadbare robe as depicted in bad movies and blog posts. Of course, all writers are the coffee-guzzling, unkempt superstitious sort.<|n|><|n|>In college, the editor of the literary review approached me with a copy of my short story in hand.

After he complimented the story, he said in a smaller voice that I didn\\u2019t look like a writer, to which I responded, \\u201cWell, what the fuck is a writer supposed to look like?\\u201d<|n|><|n|>You don\\u2019t need to write every day if that\\u2019s not your way; you just need to be committed to what you write.<|n|><|n|>Back then, I had moxie.<|n|><|n|>I was born to write, but I was also born to build brands, and this realization often created tension between the two worlds I inhabited.

Wow, I didn\\u2019t know you were a writer.\\u201d<|n|><|n|>It\\u2019s possible to be more than one thing. Few people realize this simple, true fact.<|n|><|n|>Writers don\\u2019t \\u201clook\\u201d a certain way. There is no one way to be a writer or to write a novel other than your way. I don\\u2019t toil away every morning in front of a Word document. Instead, I negotiate contracts with clients on conference calls, mentor marketing executives, beg for student loan deferments (\\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll hold\\u201d), build businesses (\\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll continue to hold\\u201d), and write when I can because my dark, experimental fiction isn\\u2019t paying the bills.<|n|><|n|>Sometimes it\\u2019s okay, even downright necessary, to take the paycheck. While seeing your book prominently displayed on the new fiction table at Barnes and Noble is sexy (and also a beautiful fiction for most writers in its own right), having a home to come home to and a hot meal is even sexier. The constant of basic creature comforts far outweighs the suffering, starving artist trope.<|n|><|n|>You don\\u2019t need to write every day if that\\u2019s not your way; you just need to be committed to what you write. Determination and persistence are the most valuable weapons in a writer\\u2019s arsenal. Writing comes more easily to me than most, but that doesn\\u2019t matter if I don\\u2019t commit myself to the work. Nothing happens until you move\\u2014until words get on the page.<|n|><|n|>Let\\u2019s first get something crystal-clear. Even when you\\u2019re not physically putting thought to paper, you\\u2019re writing. You\\u2019re thinking about your characters on the way to work. You\\u2019re jotting down dialogue in bed at night. You\\u2019re doing research while eating lunch at your desk. You\\u2019re dictating scenes into your phone on the 405 because traffic hasn\\u2019t moved in an hour, and writing is better than having a rage blackout. Being a writer is about understanding that the work that goes into the writing is just as important and relevant as the writing itself.<|n|><|n|>We fear and succumb to failure before we\\u2019ve typed our first word without understanding that success is comprised of a million little failures.<|n|><|n|>Agatha Christie once said, \\u201cThe best time for planning a book is while you\\u2019re doing the dishes.\\u201d This is how I\\u2019ve managed to publish two books and countless stories and essays over the past two decades. I created space and time for the work while understanding the pragmatic reality otherwise known as life. Neuroscience tells us that we\\u2019re wired to cleave to that which is safe and known. Experience and repetition define that knowing. Along comes an idea for a book\\u2014a dense forest rife with unknowns\\u2014and if given the choice, we\\u2019ll file our taxes and our nails over putting thought to type. That\\u2019s one of the many arcane ways we stand in our own way.<|n|><|n|>We retreat into the comfort of complacency instead of risking the possible magic of a new reality. We fear and succumb to failure before we\\u2019ve typed our first word without understanding that success is comprised of a million little failures. We give up because the largeness of the novel is a weight too heavy to bear instead of thinking about writing as Margaret Atwood would have it: \\u201cA word after a word after a word is power.\\u201d<|n|><|n|>You build a house brick by brick. You rely on drawings, schematics, measurements, and plans and make adjustments as you go. No one wakes one day and\\u2014poof\\u2014there\\u2019s the house. The act of building is the becoming, so why would writing be any different? You build a book word by word, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, page by page, chapter by chapter. And there you have it, what Sylvia Plath once called \\u201cthe long short story.\\u201d We often forget the smallest of parts creates the beautiful whole.<|n|><|n|>The first substantial revision of my second book in 2014.<|n|><|n|>In Zadie Smith\\u2019s beloved essay \\u201cThat Crafty Feeling,\\u201d she archetypes two kinds of writers: the Macro Planner and the Micro Manager. The Macro Planner lives for their notebook, Post-its, sketches, plot outlines, and character sketches; they\\u2019ve written the whole book in their head before they even sat down to type. They live for the blueprints and plans, and the house is pre-fab. Apparently, Graham Greene was a Macro Planner. Meanwhile, the Micro Manager plays the page as it lays. They start with the first line and somehow navigate their way to the last one, and they have no idea where the story will go. Smith puts it this way:<|n|><|n|>Micro Managers build a house floor by floor, discretely and in its entirety. Each floor needs to be sturdy and fully decorated with all the furniture in place before the next is built on top of it. There\\u2019s wallpaper in the hall even if the stairs lead nowhere at all.<|n|><|n|>While most of my waking life is engineered by my type-A personality, my writing life is ostensibly nomadic. As much as I want to create an outline and various endings, I always find myself wrapped up in a particular character and taking joy in seeing where the character goes. For me, the writing is more heated and ephemeral, and it\\u2019s that heat that keeps me curious and mobile. I am notorious for writing multiple drafts of a novel because certain plotlines didn\\u2019t work or the ending fell flat or some characters needed to be excised or I just realized I needed something in the middle of the book although I\\u2019m not quite sure what that something is. In my second book, Follow Me Into the Dark, I didn\\u2019t develop the principle plot twist until my third substantial rewrite.<|n|><|n|>Now that I\\u2019ve sent you into a panic, know that I\\u2019ve shifted my process to be more of fusion between the micro and macro. I no longer walk into the complete unknown. Here\\u2019s how I do it:<|n|><|n|>1. Decide if You Can Live With Your Character or Idea Long-Term<|n|><|n|>Over the years, I\\u2019ve read articles, books, and news reports, and I\\u2019ve felt the spark. Maybe I should write about dissociative fugue states! Maybe I should retell Jonestown from Jim Jones\\u2019 wife\\u2019s point of view! The sparks are the equivalent of standing in the supermarket checkout line and padding your cart with issues of Us Weekly and Snickers bars. The ideas offer instant gratification but nothing sustaining over the long haul.<|n|><|n|>Then I road test each idea for a couple of weeks. Am I up for the research? Who are my principle characters? Do they fascinate me enough for 200 pages plus rewrites? Even if I don\\u2019t know the plot just yet (I almost never do), could I sketch out a vague idea of where the story could go? What are my three acts? I tend to map out the general idea for the book, and I spend a little more time on the characters. If I\\u2019m bored after two or three weeks, odds are I\\u2019ll be bored after a few months.<|n|><|n|>2. Start Sketching a Loose Character/Plot Outline<|n|><|n|>If I don\\u2019t hate the plot or the people, I compose real character sketches. As you can probably tell, I avoid the word outline because \\u201coutline\\u201d used to mean shackles and commitment, but now I realize it\\u2019s a tool that reduces the number of rewrites. I keep the plot sketch loose\\u2014it\\u2019s merely directional. Because I\\u2019m physically unable to write a book linearly (trust me, I\\u2019ve tried), I spend a little more time on the structure. Will these be alternating chapters that are character-led, or is time the primary driver of the story? I often find that drivers tend to be plot, place, time, or character, and that helps me navigate the structure.<|n|><|n|>The point here is getting to the first draft by any means necessary.<|n|><|n|>I spend more time on timelines than plotlines, if you can believe it. Mostly, I spend time with the characters. I visualize them as real people. I hear them talking (not literally\\u2014you know what I mean). I hear their way of talk. What\\u2019s their vernacular, lexicon, speech patterns, vocabulary (is there a vocabulary I have to learn)? Where do they live and is their geography pertinent to them as a character? Who are they as people? What do they like? Who do they trust?<|n|><|n|>I love writing broken people and exploring how they navigate their life, so for me, context is key. What\\u2019s their history? Do I need research for their history? For example, my lead character in my second book was a sociopath\\u2014Ted Bundy with a whisk, if you will\\u2014so I had to do a lot of research on sociopathic behavior. I commit to my characters because the more real they are to me, the stakes are higher and their actions and nuance are easier to map out. Character always leads me to plot.<|n|><|n|>3. Start Where It Feels Natural<|n|><|n|>I\\u2019ve never started a book by writing the first line\\u2014that\\u2019s entirely too loaded and too much pressure. I pick the easiest point of entry, a scene, and I often start books in the middle. Scenes are excellent because they afford you velocity. Things are happening, and people are talking.<|n|><|n|>For me, nothing happens until something moves. If I can\\u2019t see the periphery or the details of the scene, I\\u2019ll start with straight dialogue and fill in narrative later. All that matters to me is movement.<|n|><|n|>4. Know the Writing Will Be Garbage in the First Drafts<|n|><|n|>Even the most prolific authors (okay, maybe Vladimir Nabokov with his notecards is the exception) have garbage first drafts. Jhumpa Lahiri has talked extensively about her process, which includes multiple messy drafts. No one\\u2019s reading your first draft. No one expects you to have a polished draft. The point here is getting to the first draft by any means necessary. If that means creating 50 pages of exposition that you sense you might have to toss later, awesome. That means you know your characters more, the plot has become clearer, and more importantly, you start to figure out where the characters and story can\\u2019t go.<|n|><|n|>Even if you\\u2019re not writing, you\\u2019re writing.<|n|><|n|>Polish isn\\u2019t the point\\u2014movement is. Get the story down and the characters talking, and later on, you can fuss about the carpeting and the drapes. That\\u2019s what editing is for; writing is about getting a story on paper\\u2014word by word, brick by brick.<|n|><|n|>5. Assess Each Chapter<|n|><|n|>I didn\\u2019t do this practice until recently, to be candid, but it\\u2019s extraordinarily useful. I used to just write and write, and although I still do that to a certain extent, I do get a little more reflective after the draft I\\u2019ve written.<|n|><|n|>I have a whiteboard (which used to be a spreadsheet) where I jot down the pertinent details of every chapter. Where did the plot go? What happened to the characters? What do I feel is missing? (This is more about your gut.) Were there any revelations? Places I didn\\u2019t expect to go? Having this board up while I write helps because I glance at it every so often to remind me where I am and where I could potentially go. It also serves as a working roadmap, providing guidance so I don\\u2019t veer too far off course.<|n|><|n|>6. Fill the Non-Writing Spaces<|n|><|n|>Sometimes the words just don\\u2019t come. I\\u2019ve read the countless articles and books that tell you to write something, anything, and I\\u2019m here to tell you that\\u2019s nonsense. I don\\u2019t have three hours in the morning to waste on writing for the sake of writing. Instead, I can do research. I can meditate on the characters. Brainstorm plot points. Get specific on elements of the character, place, and story that are not yet known to me.<|n|><|n|>Remember, even if you\\u2019re not writing, you\\u2019re writing.<|n|><|n|>7. Make a Writing Plan Each Month<|n|><|n|>I\\u2019ve gone months without writing. From 2009 to 2013, I didn\\u2019t write at all. I don\\u2019t make a formal plan until I feel I have enough to go on. If steps one and two aren\\u2019t in play, I can\\u2019t waste time dreaming about the book. For me to prioritize the book in my life, it has to be real to me, which means I need a foundation.<|n|><|n|>After I explore the idea of the story, my commitment to it, and character and plot sketches, then I map out a list dump of all the preliminary things I need to do to get started. Then I schedule the tasks into three five-hour buckets each week. More, if I\\u2019m lucky. I break down those buckets into two-hour sprints and focus on one task of the book.<|n|><|n|>For example, the list for my second novel started with these tasks:<|n|><|n|>Research on sociopathic behavior and serial killers. Subtask: Find two or three good books and 10 articles relevant to my research. Read them.<|n|><|n|>Subtask: Find two or three good books and 10 articles relevant to my research. Read them. Narrow down the serial killer that most resembles my character and learn as much as I can about that person . Subtask: Find audio, psychological assessments, documentaries, etc. I chose Ted Bundy as a model, and I immersed myself, for better or worse, in all that was Bundy. My character mimicked much of his modus operandi down to his education and way of talk. I mapped out which traits I wanted to hone in on that fascinated me and were relevant to my character. What started as general research became a bulleted list of aspects of Bundy that could inspire my character.<|n|><|n|>.

Subtask: Complete composites of each character (this is much like the customer segmentation work I do in marketing but with less data) and determine geography, timeline, and structure. Doing so opened up additional research (e.g., how people spoke in the 1950s and 1960s, Nevada, California).<|n|><|n|>(Notice that I haven\\u2019t written a word yet with these tasks. And that\\u2019s okay.)<|n|><|n|>Write out, in paragraphs, scene summaries that I\\u2019d ideally like to develop.<|n|><|n|>Develop a scene.<|n|><|n|>I make a monthly plan and modulate during the week. If I set aside time on Thursday to write the scene and it doesn\\u2019t happen, I\\u2019ll swap that task for another one on my list so at least something gets done, and I\\u2019m moving the book forward.

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It’s about maximizing pleasure and enjoyment at the same time as minimizing pain and suffering.<|n|><|n|>Daniel Kahneman and other psychologists argue that this is one of the most important aspects of well-being. They argue that research and clinical treatments should focus on hedonism; they should amplify happiness, foster pleasurable experiences, and reduce negative emotions like sadness and dissatisfaction.<|n|><|n|>Digital games quite clearly contribute to these positive mood states — they’re fun. The interactive and rewarding features in games have been shown to result in pleasurable experiences.<|n|><|n|>Some studies have found that games help to reduce negative states like stress and sadness. They have been found to help people recover from workplace exhaustion and work-related stress — much more so than watching videos or TV.<|n|><|n|>They seem to do this by creating “effectance”: the positive feelings that come from seeing that actions have an impact or make a difference. Gamers get a sense of gratification from the ability to influence the fantasy world. They become more than just passive viewers; they become active players. This can create feelings of satisfaction and flow that contribute to satisfaction and well-being.<|n|><|n|>Eudaimonic Well-Being<|n|><|n|>Eudaimonia was originally proposed by Aristotle. He suggested that the “good life” was about more than just maximizing pleasure and happiness and minimizing suffering. He suggested that it’s also about personal grown, reason, and virtue. Eudaimonia is conceptualized as having several components, including mastery of challenges, personal growth, good relationships with others, and having a purpose in life.<|n|><|n|>More recently, Deci and Ryan have proposed the Self-Determination Theory. It parallels Aristotle’s Eudaimonia in many ways. It suggests that there are three basic psychological needs that humans try to satisfy: autonomy, or being able to guide one’s own decisions; competence, which is the need to be good at things and achieve mastery of skills; and relatedness, which is the need to connect with others.<|n|><|n|>Several studies have found that those who feel autonomous, competent, and connected to others are also much more likely to have higher well-being ratings.<|n|><|n|>Digital games are satisfying in part because they create a situation where gamers get to practice autonomy, master skills, and connect with others. They provide opportunities for gamers to make choices about what happens to them, contributing to feelings of autonomy. They provide challenges that players can overcome, contributing to a sense of mastery. And the multiplayer features of many games, including popular online games, allow gamers to satisfy their need to be connected to others.<|n|><|n|>Social Well-being<|n|><|n|>Social connectedness is perhaps one of the most important aspects of well-being. Many studies have found that the quality of our relationships is one of the biggest predictors of happiness. Basically, the better you feel about your relationships, the better you feel.<|n|><|n|>Gaming can be a social sport, but it’s usually not. More than half of frequent gamers play multiplayer games at least once a week and say that gaming is a good way to keep in touch with friends.<|n|><|n|>That could be why the research suggests that gaming can be a good way for people to develop their social relationships. Some studies have found that gaming is an effective way for people to start relationships with others and for those relationships to become deep and meaningful. It also does not seem to displace the time spent with in-person friends. Gaming also seems to lead to lower levels of loneliness. In all of these ways, gaming seems to be a potent contributor to social well-being.<|n|><|n|>So what’s the take-away?<|n|><|n|>Gaming isn’t necessarily a bad thing.<|n|><|n|>There can indeed be some negative effects, and some people can get to the point where their behaviour looks like an addiction.<|n|><|n|>But, for the majority of individuals engaging in digital games, there may also be some significant positive side-effects. The research presented here suggests that video games can actually give a powerful boost to psychological well-being.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":58}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result['predicted_content'][1]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":139},"id":"_IRZjr7R-1Kq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725805013497,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":475,"user":{"displayName":"Gokul
